# Design Patterns

## Brian Burciaga T00566000

The purpose of this repository is to go over the labs I completed in SENG 4130 Software Design Patterns. The course goes over the various design patterns used in Software Porject.

## What was completed

The following patterns were implemented:

- Adapter
- Command
- Decorator
- Factory
- Iterator
- MVC
- Observer
- State

Each design pattern has a uml diagram in their root directory

## What was not completed

- Even though I did complete the template pattern with my partners for my lab I do not feel I have a full grasp of that pattern and left it out
- Strategy Pattern was immplemented in our class project
- Singleton was done in our class project

## What would I change about the labs

- Add other design patterns in the textbook
- Implement Adapter, Decorator, Command, Factory, State, and Observer in a different application

> The labs felt cut and paste sometimes and I did expand on these in our project, but would be better to have our own concepts of implementation. Iterator pattern and MVC were implemented in my own way.

## Future work

Apply MVC and the other patterns into a game or game engine. Iterator acted as a gun that  could be useful. I could also see implementing it through something like a factory pattern. I would also later add descriptions to how the code works to explain the understanding of each pattern. Looking into patterns that work with ReactJS.
